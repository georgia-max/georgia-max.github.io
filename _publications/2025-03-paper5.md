I developed a dynamic simulation model to understand how workload impacts mental fatigue in railway traffic controllers. Using real-world data from the Belgian railway system, the model identifies a “comfort zone” for workload and shows how fatigue builds up when operators are over- or underloaded. These insights can inform scheduling, policy, and safety planning in automated transportation environments.
