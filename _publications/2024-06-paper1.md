I developed a quantitative framework to assess systems thinking (ST) skills from text, addressing the challenge of evaluating ST’s multi-dimensional nature. Using student data, we built an integrated ST index combining statistical and optimization methods (PCA, DEA, bootstrapping). The model helps identify how factors like math background and international experience relate to ST skill development.
