I developed and tested a prompting strategies for translating dynamic hypotheses (text) into causal loop diagrams (CLDs) using large language models (LLMs). With curated prompting, LLMs can generate CLDs comparable in quality to expert-built ones—dramatically speeding up the modeling process and lowering the barrier for novice system dynamicists.
