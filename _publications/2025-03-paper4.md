Causal graphs are diagrams that help us understand how different factors are connected and influence one another, making them an essential tool for studying complex problems like climate change, public health, and social dynamics. However, comparing these graphs can be tricky. Differences in variable names, graph structures, or the way relationships are represented can make it hard to assess whether two graphs convey the same information or something completely different. In this study, we explore a variety of metrics to compare causal graphs, focusing on their structure and the meaning of their variable names. We tested these methods using synthetic datasets created by artificial intelligence, simulating what might happen if hundreds of people independently tried to map out the same complex system. Our results present a comparison of these metrics, highlighting their differences in evaluating semantic meaning and graph structure. As both human- and AI-generated causal graphs become more common, the need for a rigorous and effective evaluation grows. This study lays the groundwork for developing better tools to compare and interpret complex systems.
