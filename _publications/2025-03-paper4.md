I evaluated existing NLP and graph kernel methods for comparing causal graphs—considering both structural differences and the meaning of variable names. Using AI-generated synthetic data, we simulated how different people might map the same system. Our findings highlight key trade-offs between structural and semantic metrics, paving the way for better tools to interpret both human- and AI-generated models.
