Using real-world data from Railway Traffic Control Centers, I studied how workload and automation interact to impact human errors. We found that errors are minimized when tasks are either mostly manual or mostly automated—highlighting the risks of mid-level automation. This work offers actionable insights for managing safety in complex socio-technical systems.
