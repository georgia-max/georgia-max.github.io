While advanced automation technology has alleviated human workload and gradually transformed traditional
manual work to monitoring, accidents due to human errors remain one of the largest contributors to unsafe
operations. To inform improved managerial decisions, this paper studies how reliance on automation, under
different amounts of workload, affects the number of errors in safety–critical socio-technical systems. Using a
unique real-world dataset from Railway Traffic Control Centers,
we employ count model analysis to investigate the relationship between human errors with workload and
automation usage. Our results suggest that people make fewer mistakes when doing all of (or most of) the work manually or when
monitoring the automated system that is doing all or most of the work automatically. These findings provide
actionable recommendations for managers on optimizing workload and automation usage balance for safety-
critical enviroments.
