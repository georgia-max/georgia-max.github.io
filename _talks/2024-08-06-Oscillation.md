In this talk, I introdcuce a dynamic model theorizing how organizations transition from a non-safety focus to a safety-focus following “serious” errors, a phenomenon we term as the learning phase, which subsequently diminishes over time, a phenomenon we term as the forgetting phase. This paper contributes to the understanding of organizational learning and forgetting dynamics by elucidating the effects of “serious” errors, thereby offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing organizational resilience and performance.
