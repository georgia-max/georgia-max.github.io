I presented the third paper of my dissertation in the [2024 international system dynamics conference](https://systemdynamics.org/conference/)! In this presentation I introduce a dynamic model theorizing how organizations transition from a non-safety focus to a safety-focus following “serious” errors. Extending from the concept of the oscillation cycle of Organizational learning and forgetting, our model shows that time delay, organizational culture and safety threshold within an organization can have an lasting impact on safety outcomes in the organizations.
