Abstract of the talk: 
Organizational science research has established that organizations experience an oscillation cycle of learning and forgetting, particularly in response to “serious” errors. Yet, the intricacies of this dynamic process and its implications on organizational behavior remain underexplored. This study introduces a dynamic model theorizing how organizations transition from a non-safety focus to a safety-focus following “serious” errors, a phenomenon we term as the learning phase, which subsequently diminishes over time, a phenomenon we term as the forgetting phase. Our investigation reveals three critical insights: First, the time delay in an organization's response to “serious” errors significantly influences the pattern and efficacy of learning in subsequent oscillation cycles. Second, the prevailing organizational culture, especially in terms of resource focus between innovation and safety in the existing period, profoundly affects future probability of errors. Third, the established safety threshold within an organization exerts a lasting impact on safety outcomes in the long run. This paper contributes to the understanding of organizational learning and forgetting dynamics by elucidating the effects of “serious” errors, thereby offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing organizational resilience and performance.
