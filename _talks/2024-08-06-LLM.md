I presented this paper in the [2024 international system dynamics conference](https://systemdynamics.org/conference/)! In this presentation In this paper, Iintroduce and test a method for automating the translation of dynamic hypotheses (text) into Casual Loop Diagrams using large language models (LLMs)
