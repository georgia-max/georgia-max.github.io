Hello!

I'm a systems thinker and machine learning enthusiast dedicated to solving complex problems. I hold a PhD in Management Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. Additionally, I have a Master of Engineering in both Industrial and Systems Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA; formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).

My research interests span simulation modeling, machine learning, system dynamics, and dynamic decision-making. My work focuses on enhancing our understanding of the complexities in socio-technical environments, particularly those arising from the adaptation to autonomous technology.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment and Harvard Medical School at [MJ lab](https://mj-lab.mgh.harvard.edu/). 

Feel free to contact me at gliu26@mgh.harvard.edu.
