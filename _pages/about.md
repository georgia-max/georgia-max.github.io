Hello!

I'm a systems dynamics modeller and machine learning enthusiast dedicated to solving complex problems. I hold a PhD in Management Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. Additionally, I have a Master of Engineering in both Industrial and Systems Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA; formerly known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).

During my PhD, I worked with Dr. Konstantinos Triantis at the [Systems Performance Lab](https://splvt.com/), focusing on management in safety-critical roles, explicitly investigating the roles of workload, human errors, organizational learning, and forgetting in socio-technical systems. I  was also a PhD AI resident at [GoogleX](https://x.company/), focusing on the intersection between system dynamics and large language models (LLMs) to address systemic disparities.

My research interests span simulation modeling, machine learning, system dynamics, and dynamic decision-making. My work focuses on enhancing our understanding of the complexities in socio-technical environments, particularly those arising from the adaptation to autonomous technology.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment and Harvard Medical School at [MJ lab](https://mj-lab.mgh.harvard.edu/).
