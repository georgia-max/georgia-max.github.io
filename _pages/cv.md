Education
======
* Ph.D in Industrial and Systems Engineering, 2024
* M.Eng. in Industrial and Systems Engineering, 2024
* M.Eng. in Computer Science, 2024
* B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering, 2018

Work experience
======
* **2024-present: Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital**
  * Developed a database-backed website using Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate text into causal loop diagrams, integrating data management and visualization capabilities to streamline and enhance the translation process. Presented at the International System Dynamics Conference.
  * Led a research project by identifying grant opportunities, writing grant applications, setting up an Azure cloud environment for the lab, and running experiments, demonstrating strong project management skills.
  * Supervised and mentored research assistants, providing guidance and support on a research project, fostering their development and contributing to the project's success.
  * Worked on 2 National Institution of Health projects with academics and operational team. 


* **2022-2023: PhD A.I. Resident at Google [X]**
  *  Worked on a confidential early-stage project within a dynamic startup environment. As part of a small, agile team, developed System Dynamics models using Large Language Models (LLMs) to investigate and enhance global social goods. Successfully developed a minimum viable product (MVP), which is now patent pending.
  * Collaborated with legal professionals, social workers, banking experts, and university professors to develop a System Dynamics model. Conducted group model-building sessions to ensure comprehensive input and alignment from all stakeholders.
  * Leveraged a large-scale dataset from the Census and American Community Survey (over 30,000 data points) to calibrate for a System Dynamics model, predicting future trends and delivering actionable insights for strategic decision-making. 



* **2018-2024: Graduate Research Assistant at Virginia Tech**

  * Develop a method to measure and optimize workload management between human and autonomous systems in traffic control rooms utilizing machine learning algorithms and non-parametric methods as part of an NSF grant.  
  * Conduct group model-building interviews at Belgian Railway Company to understand traffic controllers' use of automation under adverse conditions, resulting in a system dynamics model simulating the organization’s dynamic tradeoffs between safety and non-safety priorities. 
  * Developed a System Dynamics model using 4000 hours of real-world workload data to analyze workload-fatigue dynamics in safety-critical monitoring roles, providing managers at the Belgian Railway Company with actionable insights to optimize performance and safety. 
  *	Developed a Multi-dimensional Index to evaluate Systems Thinking Skills from textual data, utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a more accurate quantitative measurement of students' systems thinking skills. 
  *	Worked on 3 National Science Foundation projects with academics and industry researchers across Europe and the US.
